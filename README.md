# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a React front-end for a web application. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

Provide a brief description of your React project here, including its purpose and key features.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run this React project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the project repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/darkevo24/FE-FCQA.git
   ```

2. **Change into the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd user-management-dashboard
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies** using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

- **`npm start`** - Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make edits, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

- **`npm test`** - Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **`npm run build`** - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready for deployment. Check the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

- **`npm run eject`** - Please note that this is a one-way operation. If you "eject," you cannot go back. Ejecting will remove the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project, giving you full control over them. All other commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, which you can customize.

  You don't have to use `eject` unless you have specific customization needs. The default configuration is suitable for small to medium deployments.
